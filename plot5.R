## Question:
## How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore City? 


# Read PM2.5 emissions dataset
emissions.df <- readRDS('summarySCC_PM25.rds')

# Read emission source classification dataset
scc.df <- readRDS('Source_Classification_Code.rds')


# Get the emissions from motor vehicle sources (type = ON-ROAD) in Baltimore City (fips code: '24510')
baltimore.motor.emissions.df <- emissions.df[emissions.df$type == 'ON-ROAD' & emissions.df$fips == '24510', ]

# Get the total Baltimore emissions from motor vehicle sources by year
baltimore.motor.emissions.by.year.df <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, data = baltimore.motor.emissions.df, FUN = sum)
